## Advent of Code 2020

My code for the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) challenges for 2020.
I decided to learn and use typescript for this year's edition.

If you have any remarks or improvements for my use of TypeScript (or javascript for that matter), please do let me know, I want to improve!
